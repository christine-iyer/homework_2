## Written HW #1 

### How Does The Internet Work ?

The terms client and server can refer to both a physical device (computer, tablet, phone, etc.) but can also refer to a software process. For example:

     - Database software such as PostgreSQL and web servers like Apache are examples of software processes behaving as servers.

     - Browser software such as Chrome or Firefox are examples of software clients.

     - Physical servers connected to the Internet are also referred to as hosts.

     - Web developers usually think of a "web browser" when they hear "client".

     - Note that during development, your computer will plays the role of BOTH client and web server, but eventually when you deploy industry standard applications (UNIT 3), you will completely decouple your front end and back end.  

     Letâ€™s say you went to a restaurant for dinner and were seated in the dining room.

You decide to order a burrito from the items listed on the menu.
